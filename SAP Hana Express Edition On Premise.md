    - When you download **SAP HANA Express Edition** from the **SAP Download Manager**, it is typically provided as a **preconfigured virtual machine image. ** 
    - **.ova file** (for VirtualBox or VMware) – This is an "Open Virtual Appliance" format that contains the entire virtual machine setup, including the operating system, SAP HANA software, and preconfigured settings
    - PDF document for configuring in VMware. passwords, steps
    - [VMware Workstation or VMware Player: ]()
    - [Oracle VirtualBox: ]()
    -  **Why can't you directly run it without VirtualBox or VMware?** 
    - The **.ova file** is designed to run inside a virtualized environment that mimics the hardware and software configuration required by SAP HANA. It already includes a Linux-based OS (SLES or RHEL) and all necessary dependencies.
    - Without a hypervisor like **VMware** or **VirtualBox**, you would have to manually install and configure SAP HANA on a bare-metal server running a compatible OS, which is complex and time-consuming.
